### Summary:

America’s pastime is full of deep data and measurable trends.  The dataset analyzed contains 1,157 professional baseball players.  This will include their respective weights, heights and handedness.  With this information we can determine if any of these three factors, on average, can contribute to making a higher performing baseball player.


### Design:

+ My main design choice for the study was histograms.  The histograms would be able to quickly convey any advantage a certain stat bin had over the other bins. Each of the histograms could be shown either vertically or horizontally.  Smaller number of bins on the x-axis where applicable.

+ Line graphs could also work for this as they can show more trend data than a histogram is capable of.  I will likely include at least one to show the visual difference.

### Feedback:

Here is the feedback I received from a co-worker:


+ Have a set color for each stat (weight, height and handedness)

+ For handedness dashboard
    - Rotate both histograms to horizontal bar graphs
	- Sort HR desc order
	- Add in average HR and Avg as a comparison line
	- Change scale for Avg to make HR stand out as info to grab attention
	
+ For weight dashboard
	- Add in avg trend line for both histograms for comparison (this gives morea sense of how strongly the factor is affecting the players' performance)
	- Turn all bars into one color, light blue (borderline transparent)
	- Add a trend line in red
	- Remove column numbers as hover/trend line will be sufficient
	
+ For height dashboard
	- Same info from weight dashboard
	- Make outlier from HR graph dark blue to highlight potential incorrect data/outlier

+ Add in a conclusion dashboard to summarize findings
